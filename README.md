Creating a website after learning flexbox.

Hey,
    The divs have a weird name as I couldn't come up with better word for it. The CSS is a mess and HTML is kind of meh!, I reckon I would improve day by day as this is my first project that I did without taking any help either from google and nor from any source and the only exception was "border-radius". So, keep in mind that this is done by an inexperienced web-developer who learnt HTML and CSS in 1 week and made this project in 2 days. 

                                    Thank You.
